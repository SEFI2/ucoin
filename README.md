# Business Model for a New Crypto Token - UCoin
## Description
This project briefly explains the business model of a new crypto token being created at Intelligent Enterprise Lab at Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST) with a purpose of adding comfortability and convenience for stakeholders in transferring, exchanging or simply buying/selling any goods between each other, and if needed, deploy Smart contracts to set their own conditions. It also describes the parties involved in the university environment, their interest in adapting the new crypto token, the advantages of using Smart contracts, and the other functionalities of crypto tokens. 

## What is UCoin?
UCoin is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network that lets UNIST students to use it as a complementary currency to the Korean Won. It can be earned, spent, received or sent like any other currency but with more features that make your life easier. What exactly distinguishes it from national currency aside is that token can be programmed in a way that meet your own requirements which is widely known these days as Smart contracts. More examples on how UCoin can be used will be given in ***What can I do with UCoin?*** section.
#### Notes
 - __Ethereum based ERC20 Tokens__: In Ethereum tokens represent any tradable goods such as coins, loyalty points etc. You can create your own crypto-currencies based on Ethereum. Additionally the benefit of following ERC20 standard is that your tokens will be compatible with any other client or wallets that use the same standards.
 - __Smart Contracts__: Smart Contracts are self executing code blocks deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. They contain data & code functions. Contracts make decisions, interact with other contracts, store data and transfer Ether (the unit of crypto-currency in the Ethereum blockchain) among users.

## What can I do with UCoin?
The purpose of the new crypto token is to create an alternative marketplace for issuing and exchanging digital assets in a decentralized manner.
You can:

 * Send and receive UCoin
 * Issue new tokens to digitalize assets, and use Ethereum as underlying exchange/transfer network for the tokens
 * Send, receive, burn/mint and freeze/unfreeze tokens
 * Propose to create trading pairs between two different tokens
 * Send orders to buy or sell tokens through trading pairs created on the chain

## Stakeholders
This is a list of stakeholders involved in our environment:
* Undergraduate students
* Graduate students
* Faculty members
* Staff
* UNIST itself
* Service providers
  * Washing machine in dormitories
  * Lockers at Gym and Library
  * Certificate printing machines at Library and Main Administration Building
  * All printers on campus
The following list of stakeholders will become member of our environment soon. Currently, we are developing a strategy to incentivise them to adapt our crypto tokens
* Third parties
  * Cafeteria
  * Cafes and Coffeeshops
  * Bank

## Key Activities

### Transferring cryptocurrency
All the students of UNIST will be able to transfer cryptocurrency to each other through an app with user-friendly interface that will be built specifically for UNIST students with some additional features such as checking the attendance in classes. Sometimes people may forget about the loan they have taken from somebody and in order to avoid this kind of situations, people might deploy Smart contracts to set a specific time and the amount of cryptocurrency to be transferred. It will automatically send the cryptocurrency according to the conditions stipulated in the contract.

### Exchanging or Selling/Buying goods
Very often students exchange books or any kind of goods between each other, especially, at the beginning of each semester. Many times people may find themself buying books that might be in a bad condition and they may want to return it back to the initial owner, but since the money has already been given to the seller, it might be inappropriate to ask him about it. Therefore, we can use the power of Smart contracts to resolve this issue by stipulating the conditions of a contract stating that cryptocurrency should be transferred only if buyer checks the condition and is satisfied. The same procedure can be extended to any other goods.   

### Paying for services
Aside from transferring and exchanging crypto tokens, it can also be used to pay for the actual services across our campus.
 - __Washing machine__: Tired of forgetting washing machine card or looking for a cash to deposit on it, students unwillingly need to go to nearest ATM to withdraw money and only then to pay for washing machine. With new crypto token students can pay for it using a simple QR-code that will directly withdraw tokens from your account. Simple and easy. 
 - __Printing__: Soon or late students need to print or get in a digital form their academic transcripts, certificates of enrollment or any other certificates from UNIST to apply for internships, jobs or conferences. In order to do it, students have to use printing machines which are located in library and the main administration building. It means you have to physically be on campus which might create an issue if you are outside of campus or even in a different country. Crypto token can solve this issue by deploying Smart contracts. As long as you send money to printing machine's account, Smart contract will send the relevant certificates to your own email from where you could easily print out wherever you want.

### Other features
Aside from what was mentioned before, the app through through which all transactions take place can also be used for checking the attendance in class. Your portal username and password will be the same username and password for logging into the app. All the activities in UNIST can be done through a single platform. 

## How crypto token can be purchased or earned?
- Banks: Like any other currency, crypto token can be purchased from the bank for which you have to pay a small commission fee. One unit of token will be equivalent to the minimum wage in South Korea. These days it is 8,350 KRW. The logic behind it will be related to the Academic Units (AU). You can read more about it in section ...
- Leadership Programs: Another way of getting crypto tokens is participating in leadership programs offered by Leadership Center
- Voluntary Jobs: Going to an orphanage or elderly home, helping staff of UNIST to organize events, and many other activities can be rewarded with crypto tokens
- Tutoring: Teaching is the best way to learn. It's a historically proven fact. Tutor other students and get paid for it.
- Parliament of UNIST: Working as a part of a parliament and contribute to the well-beings of UNISTars is also another way to earn crypto tokens.
- Provide service to other students: If you know what you are good at, you may start helping others in exchange for crypto tokens. This notion was taken from the __"Time Banking"__, where people help or provide some services to other individuals in exchange for complementary currency.

## Key Resources
- __Blockchain app platform__: an app with user-friendly interface through which crypto tokens will be managed
- __Ethereum Wallet__: a personal wallet that will keep private and public key of each individual
- __An internal transaction pricing mechanism__: 
- __Community__: all stakeholders involved in the environment
