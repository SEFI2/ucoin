# Business Model for a New Crypto Token - UCoin
## Description
This project briefly explains the business model of a new crypto token being created at Intelligent Enterprise Lab at Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST) with a purpose of adding comfortability and convenience for stakeholders in transferring, exchanging or simply buying/selling any goods between each other, and if needed they might deploy Smart contracts to make up their own conditions. It also describes the parties involved in the university environment, their interest in adapting the new crypto token, the advantages of using Smart contracts, and the functionality of crypto tokens. 

## What is UCoin?
UCoin is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network that lets UNIST students to use it as a complementary currency to the Korean Won. It can be earned, spent, received, sent like any other currency. What distinguishes it from national currency is that you can pay token can be used across our campus for a variety of reasons  and be programmed in a way that will be suitable for you. 
#### Notes
**Ethereum based ERC20 Tokens**: In Ethereum tokens represent any tradable goods such as coins, loyalty points etc. You can create your own crypto-currencies based on Ethereum. Additionally the benefit of following ERC20 standard is that your tokens will be compatible with any other client or wallets that use the same standards.
**Smart Contracts**: Smart Contracts are self executing code blocks deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. They contain data & code functions. Contracts make decisions, interact with other contracts, store data and transfer Ether (the unit of crypto-currency in the Ethereum blockchain) among users.

## What can I do with UCoin?
The purpose of the new crypto token is to create an alternative marketplace for issuing and exchanging digital assets in a decentralized manner.
You can:

 * Send and receive UCoin
 * Issue new tokens to digitalize assets, and use Binance Chain as underlying exchange/transfer network for the assets
 * Send, receive, burn/mint and freeze/unfreeze tokens
 * Propose to create trading pairs between two different tokens
 * Send orders to buy or sell assets through trading pairs created on the chain
 * Watch the DEX market to confirm price and market activity of certain assets

## Stakeholders

## Key Activities

### Transferring cryptocurrency
All the students of UNIST will be able to transfer cryptocurrency to each other through an app with user-friendly interface that will be built specifically for UNIST students with some additional features such as checking the attendance in classes. Sometimes people may forget about the loan they have taken from somebody and in order to avoid this kind of situations, people might deploy Smart contracts to set a specific time and the amount of cryptocurrency to be transferred. It will automatically send the cryptocurrency according to the conditions stipulated in the contract.

### Exchanging or Selling/Buying goods
Very often students exchange books or any kind of goods between each other, especially, at the beginning of each semester. Many times people may find themself buying books that might be in a bad condition and they may want to return it back to the initial owner, but since the money has already been given to the seller, it might be inappropriate to ask him about it. Therefore, we can use the power of Smart contracts to resolve this issue by stipulating the conditions of a contract stating that cryptocurrency should be transferred only if buyer checks the condition and is satisfied. The same procedure can be extended to any other goods.
